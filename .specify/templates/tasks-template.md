# Task Management Template

## Constitution Compliance
All tasks must align with the Orchestrator Engineering Constitution principles:

- **Clarity Over Cleverness**: Tasks must be clearly defined and understandable
- **Consistency is King**: Tasks follow established patterns and categorization
- **You Build It, You Run It**: Tasks include operational considerations
- **Secure by Design**: Security tasks are integrated throughout
- **Automate to Accelerate**: Automation tasks are prioritized
