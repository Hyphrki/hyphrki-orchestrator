## Agentic AI Framework Context

### Overview
Agentic AI represents intelligent systems that don't just respond to prompts; they are designed to achieve goals through autonomous decision-making, multi-step task execution, reasoning, and tool usage. Unlike basic chatbots, agentic AI systems behave like proactive assistants that can break down complex tasks, use tools, access external data, make smart decisions, and act autonomously.

### Key Frameworks Integration

#### LangGraph
- **Purpose**: Stateful, multi-step AI agents using graph-based architecture
- **Architecture**: Graph where each node is a function (LLM calls, tools, reasoning) with edges defining data flow
- **Benefits**: Structured branching logic, retries, and complex agent workflows
- **Use Case**: Building chatbots, RAG pipelines, autonomous agents with memory and feedback loops

#### Agno
- **Purpose**: Full-stack framework for building agentic AI systems with tools, memory, reasoning, and collaboration
- **Performance**: Fastest agent instantiation (~3μs), native multi-modality
- **Features**: Deterministic state handling, deep integrations for memory and vector search
- **Use Case**: High-performance agent systems requiring fast instantiation and multi-agent coordination

#### CrewAI
- **Purpose**: Multi-agent workflow management with structured collaboration
- **Architecture**: "Crew" of agents with specific roles working together toward common goals
- **Features**: Goal-based task planning, role assignment, autonomous operation within defined workflows
- **Use Case**: Complex multi-step workflows requiring specialized agent roles (research, writing, validation)

#### n8n
- **Purpose**: Low-code workflow automation with visual node-based interface
- **Architecture**: Visual workflow builder connecting apps, APIs, and databases
- **Features**: Drag-and-drop interface, conditional logic, multi-step automation
- **Use Case**: Non-technical users building AI-driven workflows through visual components

### Implementation Considerations

#### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **Unclear Roles**: Ensure each agent has unique, well-defined responsibilities
2. **Excessive Autonomy**: Set clear boundaries and constraints for agent decision-making
3. **Poor Communication**: Implement proper context sharing and output formatting between agents
4. **Resource Overhead**: Optimize workflows, use appropriate models for task complexity
5. **Lack of Evaluation**: Implement feedback loops and quality assurance mechanisms
6. **Overengineering**: Start simple, add complexity only when genuinely needed

#### Best Practices
- Define clear agent roles and responsibilities
- Implement proper communication protocols between agents
- Use appropriate resource allocation based on task complexity
- Include evaluation and feedback mechanisms
- Start with simple implementations and scale complexity gradually

### Framework Selection Criteria
- **LangGraph**: Complex branching logic, stateful workflows, RAG pipelines
- **Agno**: High-performance requirements, multi-agent coordination, fast instantiation
- **CrewAI**: Multi-agent collaboration, role-based workflows, structured task planning
- **n8n**: Visual workflow creation, non-technical users, rapid prototyping

### Integration Strategy
The Orchestrator platform will integrate these frameworks based on use case requirements:
- **Visual Builder**: n8n-based drag-and-drop interface for non-technical users
