# User Portal Integration Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary
This implementation plan outlines the complete transformation of the Hyphrki Automation Platform's user portal from a static website into a fully functional, enterprise-grade application. The plan integrates the existing user portal UI with the orchestrator backend, creating a seamless dual-application ecosystem where non-technical users can discover, deploy, and monitor automation agents while administrators maintain full control through the orchestrator interface.

## Project Context & Objectives

### Hyphrki Automation Platform Overview
The Hyphrki platform consists of two complementary applications:

**User Application (Target of this Implementation):**
- Target Audience: Non-technical users
- Purpose: Simple agent discovery, deployment, and monitoring
- Key Workflow: Browse agents → Answer questions → Deploy → Monitor

**Orchestrator (Existing Admin Interface):**
- Target Audience: Administrators and developers
- Purpose: Agent creation, user management, personalization
- Key Workflow: Create agents → Publish to marketplace → Customize for users → Monitor usage

### Core Integration Requirements
- **Backend Connection**: Connect existing UI components to orchestrator APIs
- **Shared Authentication**: Single sign-on across both applications
- **Real-time Communication**: Live status updates and notifications
